# Pi-Video

Each file starting with 'pivideo' renders a .mp4 file with (about) 100,000 digits of pi, as the code stuggles to render a million characters in one go (one million and one character if you count the dot).

In the original video, I stitched together the ten files using Openshot along with making each clip 4x faster as YouTube doesn't like videos longer than 12 hours. I don't recommend using Openshot for long renders like this as the interface glitched while rendering, displaying inaccurate information, but it worked out in the end.

I have taken the value of pi from this site: https://www.angio.net/pi/digits.html

I have included the text file I used, which contains a million digits of pi.

*I wrote this code with AI assitance.*
